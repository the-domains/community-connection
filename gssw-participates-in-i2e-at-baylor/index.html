That could mean many things to many people. But at Baylor University, it means showcasing the exciting academic opportunities Baylor has to offer to prospective students in a fun, hands-on problem-solving kind of way.</p><p>Twice a year, high-achieving high school seniors are invited to campus to participate in a weekend of activities to introduce potential students to Baylor’s academic rigor and exceptional faculty. With participation comes a $2000 scholarship and an opportunity to apply for a full tuition Faculty Scholarship.</p><p>At the end of January, 120 prospective students joined an interdisciplinary group of 14 faculty members from the Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Honors College and the Diana R. Garland School of Social Work to work through a scenario entitled “Meeting the Health Care Needs of Our Neighbors”.</p><p>“It is exciting to see faculty from around the university come together to provide a meaningful experience for these high-achieving seniors as they prepare to make decisions about college and about their future career fields,” Dr. Cam Armstrong, assistant dean of Undergraduate Curriculum & Student Affairs for the Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences, said.</p><p>Health care is about more than just addressing a patient’s or client’s physical needs, Armstrong added. The psycho-social aspect of a person’s well-being should also be addressed, and this exercise taught students about the collaborative nature health care. . The scenario was designed by Baylor faculty who also serve in professional roles such as physicians, nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and speech pathologists, to give student insight into the breath of career opportunities available within the helping professions.</p><p>“The purpose of the event was to have students think holistically about patients,” Armstrong said, “to determine what needs they have and to think critically about the best professionals and resources to assist them.”</p><p>The interdisciplinary group presented the students with the following scenario:</p><p><i>Recently, a devastating hurricane hit the Gulf coast. Homes, businesses, and infrastructure within a 100-mile radius of Galveston, Texas were deeply impacted. The City of Waco has agreed to take in 1,000 of the neediest victims from the affected area. The Family Health Center in Waco has been called on to meet the health care needs of this population. The organization has one week to prepare the facility and volunteers. The evacuees will require initial medical screenings upon arrival, and the Family Health Center must be prepared to address the health needs of this population.  The Board of Directors has called upon you, a group of health care experts, to advise the Family Health Center and oversee appropriate care for these newcomers to the Waco community.</i></p><p>Students were then grouped together to problem-solve their way to solutions on how to best manage the 1000 victims at the Family Health Center. Students were given suitcases to sift through to learn more about selected evacuees, essentially clues that led to a better understanding of a victim’s situational needs. Faculty members rotated among small groups and facilitated discussions from the lenses of their respective specialties.</p><p>Dr. Helen Harris, assistant professor in the Garland School of Social Work, described the students’ assignment like this:</p><p><i>“You will examine the role and function of helpers, specifically medical and social work helpers, responding to the sudden, forced evacuation of four persons from a natural disaster. These survivors will not have had time to plan their relocation or prepare for their journeys. They will not know how long they will be gone from their homes and loved ones or when and to what they might return. Your assessment of their situation and needs will include both medical and psychosocial needs; in social work, we call that a bio-psycho-social-spiritual assessment and plan. And that is the key…not only to assess what is wrong, but to begin to make a plan for care, for adaptation, for adjustment. In social work, we are concerned not only with what is wrong (medically and otherwise) but what is strong. We call that resilience, and it is part of the strengths perspective.”</i></p><p>Students became problem-solvers, and in the end, they presented their assessments, diagnoses and overall plan of care.</p><p>Those that participated in the exercise were excited and appreciative for the opportunity to come together to learn more about Baylor and diverse health care professions.</p><p>Christina Gaw, a senior at Belton High School, attended the event and expressed her gratefulness at being invited to contribute.</p><p>“I attended the Invitation to Excellence event [and] wanted to say thank you and that I had a lot of fun with the activity!” Gaw said. “I plan to pursue a career in medicine in the future, and this experience further showed me that the medical field is being recognized as more of an interdisciplinary area.”</p><p>Andrew Mangan, a senior from Hot Springs, Ark., said he enjoyed the project, the exposure to faculty members, and the collaborative effort to solve real community problems. He also expressed his strong desire to become part of the Baylor family.</p><p>“If given the opportunity, I look forward to using God's gifts to serve the Baylor community while growing academically, spiritually and professionally,” Mangan said.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/14205e28-7411-4fdc-aecd-38c3c02d254d.jpg"><p><i>By Nikki Wilmoth, GSSW Marketing Communications Director</i></p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="47"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="49"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="50"><span data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="53"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="54">GSSW Participates in I2E at Baylor</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="56"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="57"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
